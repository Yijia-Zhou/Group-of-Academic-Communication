# Result 6 - USP38 Promotes TBK1 Degradation in an NLRP4-Dependent Manner

这一段主要讲NLPR4在USP38 Promotes TBK1 Degradation中的重要性

首先有一个事实依据

> Since both NLRP4 and USP38 degraded TBK1 **by a similar mechanism** that promoted the K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 at Lys670    （就是USP38与NLRP4作用效果类似）

然后提出猜想

> NLRP4 and USP38 **work together** to regulate TBK1 stability.

之后用实验证明

---

第一个实验

> we performed immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis in 293T cells expressing USP38, NLRP3, or NLRP4,

第一个实验发现

> USP38 interacted with NLRP4, but not with NLRP3 (Figure 6A).

然后第二个实验验证交互的过程

> **To demonstrate the interaction between USP38 and NLRP4 in** physiological conditions, we infected THP-1 cells or PBMCs with VSV-EGFP for the indicated time points,

第二个实验发现

> and we observed the enhanced interaction between USP38 and NLRP4 after viral infection (Figures 6B and 6C). In addition, we **found** that the PYD and NOD domains of NLRP4 interacted with USP38 (Figure 6D), whereas the N-terminal domain of USP38 was essential for binding to NLRP4 (Figure 6E).     

同时

> Further experiments showed that USP38 was co-localized with TBK1 and NLRP4 (Figure S5A).

*为了证实这些发现,又做了一些实验 (括号内为结论)*

> (1)we specifically knocked downNLRP4 and **found** that【 the interaction between USP38 and TBK1was markedly attenuated (Figure 6F).】
>
> (2)we **demonstrated** that【 the dynamic interaction between USP38 and TBK1 was totally abrogated 】in NLRP4 small interfering RNA (siRNA)- treated THP-1 cells after viral infection (Figure 6G).
>
> (3)【we also observed the reduced interaction between TBK1 and TRIP or DTX4】 when NLRP4 was knocked down (Figures S5B and S5C).

结果显示

> These results suggest that USP38, TRIP, and DTX4 may bind to TBK1 in an NLRP4-dependent manner.

同时

> Luciferase reporter assay further showed that the inhibition of ISRE-luc activity by USP38 could be completely relieved when NLRP4 was knocked down (Figures S5E and S5F).

综合以上所有

> Taken together, these results suggest that NLRP4 is indispensable for the inhibitory function of USP38.  

。。。。貌似只有一个概念需要解释

**siRNA**是一类约21~25nt的RNA分子，由Dicer(RNAaseⅢ家族中对双链RNA具有特异性的酶)加工而成，**通过完全互补配对的方式与目标mRNA结合，引起其降解，从而导致靶基因的的沉默**。

然后，问题来了

```
Which phenomenon has proved that the NLPR4 is essential?
